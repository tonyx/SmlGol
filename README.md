Game of Life in Standard ml

The boolean expressions in the test file are true if the program is correct.
To evaluate them is sufficient to run from the shell (in any Unix shell)):
 cat gol.sml golTest.sml | sml | less

	(can also be mapped in vi to simulate unit test environment)

	Developed with Standard ML of New Jersey. It has been Tested also with Moscow ML (needs "mosml -P full" instead of sml" command)
